This is the story of the style I'm creating in TileMill that will eventually be an online transit map for Macon, Georgia's bus system.

I'll add screnshots here and there <img src="https://github.com/codeforamerica/Transit-Map-in-TileMill/raw/master/mta_1.png"> showing the progress because I haven't added the data files -- seemed like that would be a lot of files, yo -- and you can't actually pull this and do this. 

But should you think they should be here, tell me!
