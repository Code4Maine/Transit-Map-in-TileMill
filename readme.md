This is the story of the style I'm creating in TileMill that will eventually be an online transit map for Macon, Georgia's bus system.

Here is a current screenshot from TileMill: <img src="https://github.com/codeforamerica/Transit-Map-in-TileMill/raw/master/mta_1.png"> showing the where the project is at.

The map is also online at: <a href="http://tiles.mapbox.com/jllord/map/mta">http://tiles.mapbox.com/jllord/map/mta</a> Exciting!

I've made a lovely css/html transit legend but am having trouble getting it to drop in and be read as I intended by mapbox online so it's currently being replaced with an image until I sort that out. The markup for the legend is the repo, photos as well.

The newest of new is the tooltips with a fun bus icon. 

In progress/the future:
-bus times in the tooltips (when available)
-it's own special web site and address searching. 

Extra Goodies: The awesome <a href="https://gist.github.com/vlandham" target="_blank">Vallandingham</a> created this <a href="https://gist.github.com/2364140" target="_blank">gist</a>, using Raphael to create the legend. View it <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/2364140" target="_blank">here</a>.
