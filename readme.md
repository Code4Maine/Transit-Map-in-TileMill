This is the story of the style I'm creating in TileMill that will eventually be an online transit map for Macon, Georgia's bus system.

I'll keep this screenshot current: <img src="https://github.com/codeforamerica/Transit-Map-in-TileMill/raw/master/mta_1.png"> showing the progress because I haven't added the data files -- seemed like that would be a lot of files, yo -- and you can't actually pull this and do this -- but you could see how it's styled.
