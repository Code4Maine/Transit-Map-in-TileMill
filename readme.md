This is the story of the style I'm creating in TileMill that will eventually be an online transit map for Macon, Georgia's bus system.

Here is a current screenshot from TileMill: <img src="https://github.com/codeforamerica/Transit-Map-in-TileMill/raw/master/july2ss.png"> showing the where the project is at.

It's also got tooltips.

The map is also online at: <a href="http://tiles.mapbox.com/jllord/map/mta">http://tiles.mapbox.com/jllord/map/mta</a> Exciting! (Note, the github page will be more up to date because I won't change the online map until it's really ready to be public.)

It's also here: <a href="http://codeforamerica.github.com/Transit-Map-in-TileMill/">http://codeforamerica.github.com/Transit-Map-in-TileMill/</a>. Check out that sweet CSS legend!

The Macon Transit Authority is using the map now on their website: <a href="http://www.mta-mac.com/map.html">http://www.mta-mac.com/map.html</a>


In progress/the future:
-bus times in the tooltips (when available)
-Address searching. 

Extra Goodies: The awesome <a href="https://gist.github.com/vlandham" target="_blank">Vallandingham</a> created this <a href="https://gist.github.com/2364140" target="_blank">gist</a>, using Raphael to create the legend. View it <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/2364140" target="_blank">here</a>.
